Let me know if you would be interested in this & then I can share the budget, timelines & other details

IF USER SHOWS INTEREST TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT

Tell the user about budget, timeline & kick off project duration & ask for quotation, offer to share scope of work only if the client has shared one already & explain the project, otherwise simply ask freelancer to quote & tell that there are no further details
